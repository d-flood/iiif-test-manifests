# IIIF Test Manifests

A collection of IIIF Presentation API 3.0 manifests and images for testing purposes.
This repository automatically builds a static site with:
- **Level 0 IIIF Images**
- **IIIF 3.0 Manifests** (Created/Validated via `iiif-prezi3`)
- **Index Page** for easy browsing.

This is mainly for testing the [Triiiceratops IIIF Viewer](https://d-flood.github.io/triiiceratops/)
